Moooore papers this week! As we'd hoped, augmented reality appears rather helpful in an educational setting.

"Augmented reality to promote collaborative and autonomous learning in higher education" describes a few programs and their implementations such as ElectARmanual (helps train for installing machines) and ELECT3D (allows students to look at electrical plans). Since a lot of the support structure is already present at universities, it argues, colleges are one of the best places to start integrating AR.

"Augmented Reality as a Visual and Spatial Learning Tool in Technology Education" elaborates on the benefits of AR in a classroom setting, and talks about AR's potential to help students improve spatial ability.

"The Effectiveness of Cognitive Elaboration Using Augmented Reality as a Training and Learning Paradigm" means that AR helps provide more information in educational materials, especially with sound. It outperformed print, observation, and interactive video methods.
