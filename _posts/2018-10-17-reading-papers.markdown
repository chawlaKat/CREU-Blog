This week was all about reading research papers. Here are a few relevant selections:

"Spatial augmented reality on industrial CNC-machines" discusses ASTOR, a spatial AR system featuring flexible projection, bright imagery, and high transparency.

"Augmented-reality visualization of brain structures with stereo and kinetic depth cues: system description and initial evaluation with head phantom" describes a really cool setup that gives doctors a virtual overlay while they're doing surgery, so they don't have to switch back and forth between the procedure and the info on a computer monitor. It's implemented with a "phantom head" to provide a clearer concept of depth.

"Designing augmented reality for the classroom" discusses design principles to be mindful of while creating educational AR. Tips include making the AR program a smooth part of an existing setup, helping the teacher remain the students' focal point (supported by tech rather than distracted from), and not overloading students with extra information.
