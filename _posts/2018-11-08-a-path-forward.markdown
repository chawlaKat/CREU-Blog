Welcome, gentle readers!

Great news! After our meeting with Dr. Minear this week, I understand exactly where this project is going.

Since reading several papers, getting my bearings in Unity and Vuforia, and even attending a conference, I'm so excited to get going on the development portion of our research.

First, the project goals. We'll be creating two programs that allow students to interact with a brain model in a 3D environment. Both programs show the full volume of the brain with all of its internal structures. Both programs will also allow the students to remove slices of the brain model, to increase understanding of how those 2D images (as seen in textbooks and, more relevantly, MRIs) relate to those 3D structures. The difference between these programs is that the first is entirely virtual, while the second relies more on augmented reality. When using the AR version, participants will be able to hold 3D-printed disks in the shape of brain cross sections instead of just remote controls, providing a haptic component to the images. Our tests will focus on whether this additional tactile information helps participants improve understanding. The program development will be ongoing for the rest of this semester, and the testing will take place next semester.

Now for my part. I'll be on the development team for these two programs, using Unity and Vuforia to create the brain volume and provide interactivity. We'll need two different models: the first is the full mass of the brain, built out of its various parts, which will each be a 3D mesh object. The second is that same brain mass, but this one will be built out of cross sections that a student can remove and examine. Once those are built, we will add VR and AR interaction techniques to both.

So! This means I now get to learn all the parts of the brain, and then build them -- it should be fun.

And so, onwards we go, my friends.
