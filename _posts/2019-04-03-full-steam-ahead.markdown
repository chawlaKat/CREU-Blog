Welcome, gentle readers!

Finally got Steam to cooperate! After some hefty research, I asked Rajiv to help me integrate the SteamVR setup into my project...and he didn't know how to fix it, either. So instead, I built a blank project, and set up SteamVR there. I started re-creating my project from scratch, before realizing the smarter way to approach this was to import my previous work as assets. Which helped a ton, thank goodness!

And onwards we go, my friends.
