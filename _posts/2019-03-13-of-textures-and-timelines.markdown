Welcome, gentle readers!

Plus side, the textures finally look decent. They're loaded, linked, and aligned. (Also, I had to recreate the project from scratch since my computer stopped functioning and I didn't make backups, but I'm getting really quick at remaking this thing! And it's a little bit higher precision each time.) Minus side, we're rapidly approaching spring break, with no true usability in sight.

Ideally, the application would have been functional by now, so we can give the psychology students time to test it. But I'm already maxed out on time, and we are where we are. 

So! Instead of including the AR interactivity, we'll be implementing this application for the Vive instead, since it will cut down on time to release while still fitting into our project goals. 

Currently I'm trying to figure out how to integrate SteamVR into my existing project; I need to watch a few more tutorials, I think.

And onwards we go, my friends.
