Welcome, gentle readers!

Ah, back to it. Alright, when we left off, I was partway through adding the textures for each brain slice. It took forever, as the images were slightly different sizes that did not correspond to the object models in any way and I needed to align them manually, but it's done! Every slice now has an MRI attached, on its top and bottom face (except the uppermost and lowermost slices). 

Next step, get rid of those pesky black corners.

And onwards we go, my friends.
