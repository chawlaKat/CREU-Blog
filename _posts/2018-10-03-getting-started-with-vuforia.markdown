Wow! Vuforia was cool in theory, but seeing it in practice is so darn snazzy! We took an empty roll of duct tape (yep, Vuforia supports cylinders) and printed off an image of some river rocks (heck yeah, Vuforia works with whatever image you give it), and attached the image around the roll. Then we uploaded the image and added the dimesions of the tube to Vuforia's browser interface, created the asset package, and added it to Unity. And Unity recognized the tube! And we added a highlight to it -- the highlight moved with the real-world object! Which is exactly what was supposed to happen, but it was just so exciting to see it actually working.
