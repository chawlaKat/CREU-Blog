Welcome, gentle readers!

Okay. Okay, so Dr. Banic had been encouraging me to use a sprite object instead of a quad, but I had gotten overwhelmed as none of the tutorials I could find for it seemed to apply (they were all for 2d projects, while ours is necessarily 3d).

But...she was right.

I couldn't manipulate the quad the way I needed to, and, after digging through the depths of YouTube, I finally found an explanation for how to implement sprites in a 3d project. There's some file conversion and slight workaround shenanigans involved, but the versatility of a sprite is much more useful than a quad.

So I'm going through and re-adding all of the images. This might take a bit, but the value is definitely worth it.

And onwards we go, my friends.
