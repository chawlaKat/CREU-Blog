Welcome, gentle readers!

Good news - I survived finals! I'm headed home to Colorado, and then to India for Christmas. While I wish I'd had more time to devote to this project this semester, I'm really happy with our vision of where it's going, and I'm excited to dig more into it come January.

And onwards we go, my friends.
