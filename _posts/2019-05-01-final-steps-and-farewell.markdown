Welcome, gentle readers!

BOOM, BABY! 

I've got all of the colliders set up, for all of the slices. I haven't had time to test them yet, as I've been a little overwhelmed, but the pickup that worked for one slice has been applied to all of the slices. 

Thank you for coming on this journey with me, my friends! I'm not sure I'll have time to add another post once I'm done testing, so this may be my last entry. It's been a fantastic project!
