Welcome, gentle readers!

Okay. I've got everything implemented in order to pick up a cube (testing object), and I've set up colliders on a few of the slices (to make sure they work before doing them all). The only trouble is, the Vive isn't connecting. I rebooted, unplugged, googled, re-plugged in different ports, tried to move to another computer (which didn't have the correct ports, oops), and everything I could think of.

I'll email Rajiv; hopefully he can help.

And onwards we go, my friends.
