Welcome, gentle readers!

Alright, alright, alright! \*fist pump\* 

Great news, I'm done adding the sprites!!

I'm still not quite sure how to make the black corners transparent, but I got all the images exactly where I needed them, and set as a child of each slice; now, when a slice is moved out of the main mass of brain, its textures come with it. Amazing!

Up next is figuring out how to make the inconveniently opaque bits transparent.

And onwards we go, my friends.
