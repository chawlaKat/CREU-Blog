Welcome, gentle readers!

Are you looking forwards to Thanksgiving? I know I am! 

The history there makes me a little uncomfortable, but it's a reason to spend time with my family and eat uncomfortable (but immensely fun) amounts of food.

As I'm home in Colorado, I'm taking a break from work.

And so, onwards we go, my friends.
