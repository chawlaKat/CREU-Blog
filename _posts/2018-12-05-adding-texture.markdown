title:  "Adding Texture"

Welcome, gentle readers!

Looking back at my last entry, I was planning to create subsection models of the brain in addition to the axial (planes are visible top-down) slices we already have in the Unity project. It turns out I have a better plan.

Focusing on completely implementing the cross sections first will concentrate my efforts instead of dividing them. To that end, this week, I am adding textures to the cross sections!

I'm not sure if this is the right way to go about it, but I'm adding a plane object ("quad") for each face of the brain slice. Then, I add the .png with the corresponding MRI image to that quad. Unfortunately, they only come in rectangles -- maybe once I have all of the images attached, I can make the corners transparent? We'll find out!

And onwards we go, my friends.
