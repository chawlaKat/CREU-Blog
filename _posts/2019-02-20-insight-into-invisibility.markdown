Welcome, gentle readers!

So, good news! I found a way to make most of the images transparent (without Photoshop, because that's way out of my skill range and budget). By dropping them into Microsoft Publisher, I can choose one color in the photograph to set to transparent. This leaves some of the excess information (the MRI images include the layer of skull, which we don't need for modelling just the brain), but it does remove the background. I'll keep tweaking once I'm done with this round.

And onwards we go, my friends.
