Welcome to my blog! I'll be taking part in a CREU research project this semester, and this is where you can find updates. 

Our project is officially called 'Design and Evaluation of Interactive Mixed and Augmented Reality Systems to Improve Spatial Learning Effects when Teaching 3-Dimensional (3D) Spatial Concepts: A Case Study on 3D Neuroanatomy Courses', but I'll be referring to it as '3D Learning with AR' for brevity : )

Here's a description of the project, courtesy of our mentor Dr. Banic:
> We will work on designing and implementing 3D user interfaces and interaction techniques for Mixed and Augmented Reality Systems to help professors teach about the spatial relationships of the brain. We will conduct a study to see how well these techniques work in the classroom- yes, faculty will actually test these out in their class with real students. Some of our initial ideas are to use augmented reality (ie HoloLens, Meta2) and compare that to mixed reality with 3D printed brain slices and projecting the visual information on them. We will not just simply use the technology, but rather conducting research into how to design the interaction for the technology. This is a cross-disciplinary project, so students will be working with me (Dr. Banic) on the computing side but also work with the co-mentors in Psychology and Zoology and Physiology.
