Hello all; hope youre doing well! I sure am.

I spent this week working through tutorials in Vuforia. This is a tool that allows synchronization between real-world markers and virtual objects. The setup is completed in-browser through Vuforia, creating a package that then is exported and loaded into the Unity project. 

I theoretically know how it works -- Rajiv will be giving a demo next week for how to implement it "for real".
