Welcome, gentle readers!

It turns out the masking idea wasn't quite reasonable. It took way too long to complete a few slices. So, I went looking for alternatives, and found an answer in Microsoft, again! If I use Powerpoint instead of Publisher, I can manually select where the transparent region begins and ends, using Powerpoint's intelligent selection to follow around color borders, adding manual tweaking where necessary. 

So! I've gotten all of the slices...well...sliced, and I'm re-adding them back into the project (again). I wish there was a way to replace the existing image instead of having to create and realign a new sprite!

And onwards we go, my friends.
