Welcome, gentle readers!

I've got the images even cleaner, now! Even using Powerpoint's transparency tool, my images were a little rough. This week, I met with Sierra, our artist, and she was able to give me access to the original transparent files. 

They weren't exactly flush with the models, unfortunately, but they're way closer than the ones I did.

I haven't heard back from Raylyn, though, so I'll be implementing colliders this week.

And onwards we go, my friends.
